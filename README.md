**This code don't use JQuery or any other external library**
This project is started in a simple way, and in a OpenSource way, so every file is created in here (for the moment, is intended to keep it this way for a long time).

**Future changes**
The future changes will include event handling for mouse, keyboard and ajax.

**Expect more coding in the future**
In the future, changes will be made, but every file will be well documented.
